* Add userlist file encryption. Not quite sure which method to use yet,
  but some time in the future it will be done. (I seem to have given myself
  more trouble by changing the file format from binary to ascii.)
* Add asynchronous server/DCC connecting (nonblocking connect()). This
  does also include a server message queue of some sort. NOTE: As of March
  26 1997 DCC connecting is non blocking. Non blocking server connects might
  be of no use, don't hold your breath for it to appear.
* Fix the damned logging. (It works now, but doesn't log much.)
* Complete the mIRC DCC Resume support for incoming DCCs. Right now
  only outgoing DCCs can be resumed.
* Add a bot mirror system. (I imagine this will be a hell of a job.)
* Add an upload database to the ratio system, to prevent duplicate files. I
  am not sure what's the best method to use. Considering dbm/gdbm/ndbm. The
  most widely supported is dbm, however ndbm also seems to be available on
  most systems. Since it's a tad bit more advanced than dbm, ndbm will be the
  database manager of choice (or gdbm in ndbm compatibility mode).
* Add a VIEW command to display contents of archives, file_id.diz files etc.
* Rewrite the security settings to make it more flexible.
* Implement some more useful commands like RM, RMDIR, MV and so on.
* Make a archive testing command of some sort, so that the users may test the
  integrity of archive files. Maybe this will be redundant when the VIEW
  command is implemented.
* Port JanBot to Digital Unix. I've been told it works 99.5% already. =)
* Port JanBot to IRIX. Outkast told me he had done it with some minor changes,
  but something was not working. Possibly an mIRC bug. Ported, needs testing.
* Change the help file format, and make it stay in memory (optionally).
* Port to AIX, Ultrix (fat chance), SCO Unix, OpenBSD, NeXT, NCR Unix, Unixware
* SOCKS4/5 support. Hah! (Actually, this doesn't look too hard).
* Scheduling - Offline time etc.
* Global DCC limit / Brute force User DCC limit.
* Transferstats (what was that all about?)
* Make JanBot use multithreading, if possible. This will mainly mean that the
  DCC transfers will be even faster than with HyperDCC. It will probably not
  involve any code updates around the user interaction. The rest of the code
  is probably not reentrant.
